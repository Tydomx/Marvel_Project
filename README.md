## Purpose
An application that allows users such as Marvel Fans to get information about their favorite super hero, so that the user can understand and admire their favorite super hero.

## Technologies Used

* HTML - structuring the website and letting us give classes to elements to set up the CSS. 
* Materialize (CSS) - letting us have a framework for easier accessibility to CSS. 
* Javascript - created a modal allowing user to type in their favorite hero's name. Allowing us to request third-party API's into the website to have information about the hero and a GIF about them.
* Third-Party API's: Marvel and Giphy - Marvel API: requested information about heroes into the website, GIPHY API: requested GIF about specified heroes.

## Successes & Challenges
* Getting modal created, having side nav for mobile responsive working, and being able to fetch APIs without any issues occurring.

* Challenges: 
  * Version control through the GitHub process was an issue with human error. 
  * Difficulty at times with API's whenever things would not connect properly.
  * Some challenges making navigation for the user responsive where things would not be located as planned.

## Features hope to be implemented in the future
* Improving design
* Adding more functionality to the page, such as allowing user to log in and save their information, adding a button to have a collection of heroes.
* Adding another API to include youtube videos.
